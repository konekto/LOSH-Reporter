# Intro

## General

<!-- TODO Moe Add general info about LOSH -->

Efforts partly merged with the [OSHdata project](oshdata.com),
which published annually reports based on data crawled from the
[list of OSHWA-certified OSH projects](https://certification.oshwa.org/list.html).
Since OSHWA published [its API](https://certificationapi.oshwa.org/documentation),
no crawling is needed anymore.
And since LOSH is here to collect data also from other platforms,
we decided to take care of regular OSH data reports –
now also including data from other platforms.

Generally,
all data you will find here is also publicly available in the LOSH knowledge base.
This report is generated using the [LOSH-Reporter](
https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/LOSH-Reporter/) tool (GPL-3.0-OR-LATER).
All we do is running a bunch of pre-defined queries on LOSH's knowledge base
using that tool.
If you want to look into the raw data yourself,
e.g. to run some self-defined queries,
find it [here](https://gitlab.opensourceecology.de/verein/projekte/losh-rdf)
([CC0-1.0](https://gitlab.opensourceecology.de/verein/projekte/losh-rdf/-/blob/main/LICENSE)).
The report you are reading
is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License
([CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)).
This license covers the entire report, including the text and graphics.
OSHdata is a project of the [Open Hardware Observatory e.V. (non-profit)](https://en.oho.wiki/wiki/Imprint)
since 2021 (before is was a project of Kenny Consulting Group, LLC).

## Scope

<!-- TODO Moe Add brief description of scope -->

## Get in contact with us

OSHdata is hosted by the [Open Hardware Repository e.V. (non-profit)](

LOSH was started inside the EU-H2020-founded [OPEN!NEXT](
https://opennext.eu/) project back in 2020
and is hosted and maintained by [Open Source Ecology Germany e.V. (non-profit)](
https://ose-germany.de/) since 2022.

## This report…

<!-- TODO Moe brief intro specific to this version of the report -->

# OSH Platforms

## Introduction

Currently, LOSH collects data from the following platforms:

- [GitHub.com](http://github.com/)
- [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/)
- [GitLab.OpenSourceEcology.de](https://gitlab.opensourceecology.de/)
- [Wikifactory.com](https://wikifactory.com/)
- [OSHWA Certification List](https://certification.oshwa.org/list.html)
- [Thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/)

Additionally we have scripts catching data from:

- [Appropedia.org](https://appropedia.org/)
- [Open Know-How](https://openknowhow.org/) (including e.g. [Fieldready.org](https://www.fieldready.org/))

and making it available via GitHub (in [this repository](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/LOSH-list/)).

The minimum threshold for LOSH to be recognised as an OSH project is to have:

- a free/open license,
- a README file and
- at least one source file (other than the README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md or an image).

<!-- TODO Moe add short description of upload methods (copy from D3.4 + D3.3 report) -->

## Data input

By the publishing date of this report, the LOSH knowledge base contains:

- ${get_value(repoHosts,{"repoHost": "github.com"}, "count")} from [GitHub.com](http://github.com/) (not counting Open Know-How or Appropedia.org) (${get_value(repoHosts, {"repoHost": "github.com"}, "percent")} % of all its projects)
- ${get_value(repoHosts,{"repoHost": "gitlab.com"}, "count")} from [GitLab.com](http://gitlab.com/) (not counting Open Know-How or Appropedia.org) (${get_value(repoHosts, {"repoHost": "gitlab.com"}, "percent")} % of all its projects)
- ${get_value(repoHosts,{"repoHost": "source.mnt.re"}, "count")} from [source.mnt.re](https://source.mnt.re) (${get_value(repoHosts, {"repoHost": "source.mnt.re"}, "percent")} % of all its projects)
- ${get_value(repoHosts,{"repoHost": "wikifactory.com"}, "count")} from [Wikifactory.com](https://wikifactory.com/) (${get_value(repoHosts, {"repoHost": "wikifactory.com"}, "percent")} % of all its projects)
- ${get_value(repoHosts,{"repoHost": "certification.oshwa.org"}, "count")} from [OSHWA Certification List](https://certification.oshwa.org/list.html) (${get_value(repoHosts, {"repoHost": "certification.oshwa.org"}, "percent")} % of all its projects)
- ${get_value(repoHosts,{"repoHost": "en.oho.wiki"}, "count")} from [Open Hardware Observatory](https://en.oho.wiki) (${get_value(repoHosts, {"repoHost": "en.oho.wiki"}, "percent")} % of all its projects)
- ${get_value(repoHosts, {"repoHost": "www.thingiverse.com"}, "count")} from [Thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/) (${get_value(repoHosts, {"repoHost": "www.thingiverse.com"}, "percent")} % of all its projects)

<!--
- ${get_value(repoHosts,{"repoHost": "appropedia.org"}, "count")} from [Appropedia.org](https://appropedia.org/) (${get_value(repoHosts, {"repoHost": "appropedia.org"}, "percent")} % of all its projects)
-->

…as illustrated in @fig:repo-hosts

<!-- NOTE a bar chart with the above mentioned values, each bar splitting into accepted and rejected projects (rejected projects on top) -->
${figure("barchart", y="repoHosts.count", x="repoHosts.repoHost",title="repo-hosts", label="count")}

@fig:input-methods shows the distribution of upload methods
that have been used for this data set.

<!-- NOTE bar chart showing the distribution of uploading methods used for LOSH (auto, manifest, manifest-script, manual) -->

<!--
NOTE (set History Section invisible until there is a history)

## History

Since the first report, published back in January 2022,
data input has developed as following:

<!-- TODO ??? Robin combined historical line diagram of total count of projects per year & for each platform -->

<!---
Looking into the recent past,
@fig:data-hist-grow2 shows the grow rates for the past two years.
-->

<!-- NOTE horizontal bar chart with grow rates per platform per each of the past 2 years + a bar for the total grow rate -->
<!--
{# fig:data-hist-grow2}
-->

-->

# Licenses TODO

What separates a piece of open source hardware from a proprietary one
is primarily its license.

<!-- TODO Moe add more info, also linking the OSH legal issues guideline and the tl;dr -->

The following @fig:license-dist-ind shows the distribution of licenses
under which the _hardware_ has been published per platform.

<!-- NOTE 1 pie chart per platform showing the distribution of `spdxLicense` --> 
${figure("piechart", y="licenseDistIndNew.count", x="licenseDistIndNew.license",title="license-dist-ind", label="overall distribution of spdxLicense")}

Totalled, @fig:reciprocality is the overall distribution of licenses
used for the _hardware_.

<!-- NOTE pie chart showing the overall distribution of `spdxLicense`, sorted by strongly, weakly an non-reciprocal licensing schemes --> 
${figure("barchart", x="licensesReciprocality.reType", y="licensesReciprocality.count",title="reciprocality", label="overall distribution of spdxLicense")}

# Technology and documentation readiness

<!-- TODO Robin OTRL/ODRL assessment? (or maybe under git-based platforms) -->

# git-based platforms, OKH and Appropedia

<!-- TODO Robin See below -->

- some detailled statistics based on manifest files
  - OKH(v1) count + historical grow rate (2 years)
    - fields used (vertical bar chart) <!--- would require parsing the original YAML files-->
  - appropedia count + historical grow rate (2 years)Robin
    - fields used (vertical bar chart) <!--- would require parsing the original TOML files-->
  - on git-based platforms OKH-LOSH (manifest) count + historical grow rate (2 years)
    - fields used (vertical bar chart) <!--- would require parsing the original TOML files-->

## Community-based Assessment according to DIN SPEC 3105-2

<!-- TODO Robin See below -->

- CAB data
  - project count:
    - attested/in progress + historical grow rate (2 years)
    - OHO / OSEG
  - certification per organisation
  - average assessment time (first submission…final attestation) + variance
  - average number of comments per asssessment + variance for top & bottom 10% of assessment time

### Projects of the year

<!-- TODO ??? See below -->

2…4 projects from OSEG-CAB & OHO-CAB to be briefly presented & promoted

<!-- TODO Moe 2021: MNT Reform, OpenFlexure; something from OHO -->

<!-- TODO Moe section to be written manually -->

# Wikifactory

<!-- TODO ??? See below -->

- some detailled statistics based on their API
